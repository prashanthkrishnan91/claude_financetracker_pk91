# HANDOFF — Current Repo State

Last updated: 2026-07-18 (Lean Advisor Consolidation — Positions / Advisor / Watchlist; replaces
the stage-by-stage log with a compact state summary. Full evidence for the consolidation lives in
`REFACTOR_REPORT.md` at the repo root and in the consolidation PR body. Same-day follow-up: Run
Intel completion-classification fix after PR #473 — see bullet below.)

## Product architecture (read this first)

The authenticated app has exactly **three primary views**:

1. **Positions** (`/dashboard/positions`) — certified portfolio truth: totals, allocation split,
   freshness, per-holding detail with Intel v3 action/evidence labels, and
   reconciliation-gated FIFO tax-lot estimates (`GET /api/v1/positions/tax-lots`).
2. **Advisor** (`/dashboard/advisor`) — the **single user-facing recommendation surface**, four
   sections: (A) system readiness + bounded Run Intel, (B) deterministic Intel v3 holding
   actions (`IntelV3Cockpit`), (C) new-cash plan via the canonical Paycheck Advisor endpoint,
   (D) collapsed trust/repair drawer.
3. **Watchlist** (`/dashboard/watchlist`) — user-defined price_below/price_above criteria
   (`/api/v1/watchlist`, table `watchlist_items`, migration `v2/database/025_watchlist.sql`,
   RLS owner policy). The app never auto-selects watchlist stocks and they never enter the
   Paycheck Advisor candidate set.

Operational subpages (not primary nav): `/dashboard/import`, `/settings`,
`/dashboard/position/[ticker]`, login. `/dashboard` redirects to Positions; all legacy product
routes redirect (map in `v2/frontend/src/lib/route-redirects.ts`).

## The decision spine (one spine, no competitors)

1. Certified portfolio/transaction truth (`portfolio_service`, `import_service`, positions)
2. Current-price truth (`price_engine`; repair: `current_price_truth_repair_v1`)
3. Intel v3 evidence production (`services/intelligence/*`; agents/LLMs are **labeled evidence
   producers only**, used by the protected refresh adapters and the cert harness)
4. **Intel v3 deterministic policy** (`intelligence/v3/decision_policy_v1.decide()`) — the only
   owner of visible Buy/Hold/Trim/Sell actions
5. Allocation policy + guardrails (`allocation_policy_v1`: ETF floor 40%, stock sleeve target,
   concentration/group caps, min-trade, VTI>VOO>SPY>QQQ, cash invariants
   `allocated_cash <= cash_to_deploy`, `unallocated_cash >= 0`)
6. **Paycheck Advisor** (`POST /api/v1/advisor/paycheck-plan/preview`, cert-gated via the
   frontend Route Handler that attaches server-only `FINANCE_RUNTIME_CERT_SECRET`) — the
   canonical answer to "I have $X — what should I buy, how much, and why"
7. One Advisor view rendering both

**Intel v3 and Paycheck Advisor are complementary layers, never competitors**: Intel v3 owns
deterministic actions for existing holdings; Paycheck Advisor consumes certified truth +
Intel v3 evidence + allocation policy to place new cash. The preview response carries additive
`explanations` buckets (selected / evidence_eligible_policy_blocked / evidence_blocked /
concentration / group-cap / stale-price / missing-truth / below-min-trade / max-positions)
mapped from the Stage 12C/13A/13C diagnostic — presentation only, no new allocation math.

## Decisions that must NOT be re-litigated (historical context)

- **Do not rebuild a visible LLM/agent recommendation surface.** The legacy
  `recommendation_engine` insight-card path (`GET /recommendations/`, `AgentInsightCard`,
  `PortfolioSynthesisPanel`, flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_INTEL_V3_VISIBLE_SNAPSHOT_ENABLED`) was removed
  in the consolidation because LLM output must never own visible Buy/Hold/Trim/Sell authority
  (`KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md`). `recommendation_engine.py` + `services/agents/*` + `services/ai/`
  survive ONLY as internal evidence producers for the Intel v3 refresh adapters and the
  cert harness (`diagnostics.py`) — never re-expose them as a user surface.
- **Do not rebuild a duplicate Deploy surface.** Deploy v3 (`routers/deploy_v3.py`,
  `services/deploy/*`) and the legacy allocation engine chain (`allocation_engine`,
  `deployment_engine`, `adaptive_deployment`, `regime_engine`, deposits schedule with hardcoded
  weights, `decision_engine`, `personalized_decision_engine`, `strategy_engine`,
  `simulation_engine`, decision logs/journal, AI rebalance) were deliberately retired
  (2026-07-18). New-cash sizing belongs to Paycheck Advisor; holding actions to Intel v3.
- **Do not build a separate/new Paycheck model or endpoint family.** The paycheck evolution
  lineage (Stage 12B policy → 12C ETF preference → 12D preview read model → 12E UI → 13A
  evidence-aware stock gating → 13C production `current_holdings` snapshot contract + independent
  policy/evidence gates, PR #471) all lives in `allocation_policy_v1.py` behind the one endpoint.
  Extend it additively there.
- **Do not delete the Advisor allocation spine** (`allocation_policy_v1`,
  `paycheck_plan_preview`) — rejected PR #472 did exactly that and was rejected for it.
- **Run Intel is bounded on-demand, not worker-dependent** (Stage 13B): `POST /intel/v3/run`
  enqueues and, when `INTEL_V3_ON_DEMAND_REFRESH_ENABLED=true`, drains up to 3 batches × 10
  jobs / 90s via `analyst_refresh_on_demand_drain_v1`. A full portfolio may need multiple
  clicks — the Advisor UI shows partial progress and "Continue Intel run". The separate Railway
  worker services remain optional and OFF. `snapshot_available_after_run` (in `routers/intel_v3.py
  ::_augment_with_on_demand_status`) requires all three: `snapshot_source == "worker_certified"`,
  `evidence_freshness_state == "certified_current"`, and no remaining bounded-drain work —
  an old worker_certified snapshot with stale/republish_pending freshness or a resumable partial
  drain must never report completion (post-#473 production regression fix).
- **Cost guard posture stays** (ACTIVE): `INTEL_BACKGROUND_WORKERS_ENABLED=false` master kill
  switch, `INTEL_V3_SNAPSHOT_WRITES_ENABLED` write guard, interval clamps. Do not re-enable
  background workers casually; see `docs/deploy/RAILWAY_COST_GUARD.md`.
- **Truth/repair diagnostics are protected operator infrastructure** (Stage 10B/11A/11B/12C
  lineage): `/diagnostics/finance-intel/*` (~36 cert-gated endpoints incl. financial-truth
  baseline, books reconciliation, current-price repair, next-buy diagnostic). They are not
  primary navigation and must not be deleted for looking unused.
- **Policy tickers live in config** (`v2/backend/app/policy_tickers.json`, loader
  `services/policy_tickers.py`, override `POLICY_TICKERS_FILE`) with exact-parity tests
  (`test_policy_tickers.py`). Never re-hardcode ticker membership in policy modules; provider
  symbol-translation maps stay in provider code.
- **Tax lots are estimates, reconciliation-gated** (`tax_lot_engine.py`): every production
  tx_type explicitly classified; unsupported/unknown share events block authoritative display;
  calendar-anniversary long-term logic; shares tolerance max(0.0001, 0.1%), basis 2%;
  no dollar tax-liability math anywhere; US-federal estimates-only labeling.
- **`recommendations_trusted` is always False** in the preview contract; `numeric_plan_trusted`
  gates investable presentation. Never render an untrusted plan as actionable.

## Current test/build state (post-consolidation)

- Backend: full suite green (`8290 passed, 0 failed` at consolidation; includes the conftest
  event-loop guard and stale-fixture modernization — both test-only).
- Frontend: full jest green; `tsc --noEmit` clean; `next build` green.
- Baseline before consolidation (main @ PR #471): backend 93 failed / 8910 passed
  (documented pre-existing failures), frontend 3 suites failing to compile.

## SQL / env state

- Migration `v2/database/025_watchlist.sql` is REQUIRED (manual, additive) for Watchlist;
  endpoints return 503 `watchlist_migration_required` until applied. Everything else unchanged.
- `FINANCE_RUNTIME_CERT_SECRET` (Vercel, server-only) + `FINANCE_RUNTIME_CERT_ENABLED=true`
  and cert user config (Railway) power the Advisor cash plan.
- `INTEL_V3_ON_DEMAND_REFRESH_ENABLED=true` (Railway) recommended so Run Intel drains without
  the optional worker. `INTEL_V3_SNAPSHOT_WRITES_ENABLED=true` needed for new snapshots.
- Backend `INTEL_V3_VISIBLE_SNAPSHOT_ENABLED=true` (Railway) MUST stay set — the Advisor view's
  Intel section reads `GET /intel/v3/snapshot`, which 404s without it. Only the frontend
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_...` variant of this name is dead. Backend boot-required vars remain
  `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`,
  `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_INTEL_V3_VISIBLE_SNAPSHOT_ENABLED` is no longer read by any code — safe to
  remove from Vercel at leisure (documented cleanup, not required).
