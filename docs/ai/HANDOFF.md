# HANDOFF — Current Repo State

Last updated: 2026-05-10

## Purpose

This file is **current operational state**, not a historical log. It is meant to be loaded into context every session, so it must stay compact. Do not append PR-by-PR history. When something changes, replace or summarize the affected section instead of adding new entries.

## Current product stage

- Roadmap stage: Stage 1 → Stage 2 transition (Intel v3 correctness/evidence trust → Deploy exact-dollar action plans). See `docs/product/ROADMAP.md`.
- Active build queue item: continue Intel → Deploy transition; define / confirm Deploy action-plan foundation. See `docs/product/BUILD_QUEUE.md`.
- Current north-star reminder: Intel → Deploy → Watchtower; deterministic backend policy owns visible Buy/Hold/Trim/Sell authority. See `docs/product/NORTH_STAR.md`.

## Current architecture / runtime state

- OS v4 is the canonical operating system. No v4.2 or v5 labels.
- Visible decision authority is owned by the deterministic Intel v3 backend policy. LLMs / agents / research workers cannot own final visible action authority.
- For long architecture references, read `artifacts/Intel_v3_Architecture_Plan_Draft2_*`, `artifacts/Intel_v3_Architecture_Plan_Draft3_*`, and `artifacts/Intel_v3_Living_Cockpit_Status_Reconciliation_*` rather than copying them here.
- Runtime workflow guardrails: advisory `.claude/hooks/ai_os_advisory.py` reminds about contract / claim-safety / SQL / env paths. No blocking hooks.

## Recent meaningful PRs

Keep this section small. Only entries that affect future work; replace older lines as they age out.

- 2026-05-10 — workflow architecture hygiene: removed claude-flow helper/hook stack from `.claude/settings.json`, deleted `.claude/helpers/`, `.claude-flow/`, and legacy `.claude/commands/` claude-flow docs; compacted this HANDOFF; added handoff maintenance rule.
- 2026-05-10 — workflow/setup asset hygiene (PR #269): removed ~75 stale/duplicate workflow/setup assets across root, `.claude`, `docs/ai`, and experimental folders; CLAUDE.md anchors updated to point at `.claude/skills/` directly.
- Earlier Intel v3 / Deploy-prep / evidence-check copy work has been folded into product source-of-truth docs and is no longer tracked PR-by-PR here. See `docs/product/DECISION_LOG.md` and `docs/ai/MISS_LEDGER.md` for durable records.

## Active invariants / safety packs to remember

Named packs in `docs/ai/SAFETY_PACKS_AND_ARCHETYPES.md` (Finance section) own the rules. The packs themselves are the source of truth — do not paste their contents elsewhere:

- Deterministic Decision Authority Pack
- Valuation Safety Pack
- Data Truth / Evidence Suppression Pack
- Deploy/Watchtower Boundary Pack
- Backend-only Scaffold Pack / No Visible Behavior Change Pack / Test Tier Pack (cross-cutting)

## Known risks / unresolved issues

- Stage 2 (Deploy) entry gate not yet declared formally — the Deploy action-plan foundation is the next piece of plumbing.
- Watchtower trigger model is still scoped but unbuilt; no live alerts.
- Research artifact UX is intentionally deferred until decision/action loop is stable.

## Next recommended step

Clarify or implement the Deploy action-plan foundation slice (one capability slice). Use the OS v4 work-order shape and the Deterministic Decision Authority Pack + Backend-only Scaffold Pack.

## Handoff maintenance rule

- This file is current state only. It is not an append-only log.
- Keep under ~250–500 lines. If it grows past that, **compact before adding** — summarize older sections, do not extend them.
- Every meaningful PR may update this file, but by **replacing or summarizing**, never by appending.
- Move durable historical detail to `docs/ai/MISS_LEDGER.md` (workflow/process misses) or `docs/product/DECISION_LOG.md` (product decisions). Do not preserve old noise just because it exists.
- Do not create new archive files for routine PRs. An archive is justified only when current-state value is being replaced and the original detail is still useful elsewhere.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ai/AI_REPO_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`, and `docs/ai/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` enforce this rule.
