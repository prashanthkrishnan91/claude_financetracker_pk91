# Build Queue

The active product queue. Every meaningful implementation PR should map to one item here.

Update via `.claude/skills/build-queue-update/SKILL.md` after meaningful roadmap decisions or merged PRs. Keep updates concise.

## Now

- **Deploy v3 production readiness validation** (Stage 2, still in progress). Stages 2.5A–2.5D complete. Call `GET /api/v1/deploy/v3/readiness` against real data — the `next_required_action` field tells you exactly which gate is blocking and what to do. Possible outcomes: (1) create fresh snapshot; (2) add target allocations; (3) fix target total to [98%, 102%]; (4) set deploy policy env vars; or (5) all gates pass → Stage 2 exit validation can proceed. Do not exit Stage 2 until a certified action-plan path exists end-to-end.

## Next

- Watchtower trigger foundation (Stage 3 entry). Stays here until Deploy has a useful certified action-plan path.

## Later

- Alerts / action feedback.
- Research artifact UX.
- Premium cockpit design polish.
- Real tax-lot / wash-sale guardrail logic on top of the per-item finalization + plan-rollup contract. Design-dependent: requires explicit tax-lot / trade-history source decisions before any build can start; do not auto-promote into Now.

## Completed

- **Stage 2.5D** — Deploy v3 production readiness diagnostic v1 — `GET /api/v1/deploy/v3/readiness`; reports all gate statuses, snapshot age, per-ticker market-value coverage, target allocation gaps + total %, policy config presence (no secret values), suppression reasons, plain-English `next_required_action`. 34 new tests; 519 deploy tests total; 0 failed. Backend-only, no SQL, no UI.
- **Stage 2.5C** — Deploy v3 target-allocation + policy readiness hardening v1 — portfolio-level target total bounds (98%–102%) enforced (no cash/residual contract yet; near-full specification required); duplicate DB rows → CONFLICTING trust; invalid policy → UNSUPPORTED fail-safe; 3 new suppression reasons in source metadata. 46 new tests + 38 updated; 485 deploy tests total; 0 failed. Backend-only, no SQL, no UI.
- **Stage 2.5B** — Deploy v3 snapshot market-value source v1 — `PortfolioService.create_snapshot()` enriches `positions_data` with `market_value_usd` per position when price is valid/fresh. Cost basis never promoted. Fail-safe on missing/stale/invalid prices. 33 new backend tests; 72 total for adapter + enrichment (0 failed). No SQL, no providers, no LLM.
- **Stage 2.5A** — Deploy v3 certified sizing source adapter v1 — `deploy_sizing_source_adapter_v1.py` wired into `GET /api/v1/deploy/v3/plan`. Reads `portfolio_snapshots` + `target_allocations` + Settings. Source metadata expanded with readiness gates. Adapter is wired but `exact_dollar_ready` depends on source completeness (see Now). 51 new tests; 4469 total; 0 failed.
- **Stage 2.4B** — Plain-English read-only Deploy v3 UI surface — `DeployV3Panel` on Deploy page; calls `GET /api/v1/deploy/v3/plan`; renders `plan_readiness_status`, counts, Intel v3 authority note, honest sizing-not-connected disclaimer. 25 frontend contract tests; 0 backend changes.
- **Stage 2.4A** — Deploy v3 read-only API endpoint — `GET /api/v1/deploy/v3/plan` live; authenticated, read-only; returns plan rollup from latest Intel v3 snapshot.

## Blocked

- _none recorded_

## Validation Needed

- _none recorded_

## Design Pause Candidates

- Premium cockpit design polish after Deploy / Watchtower loop is stable.
- Real tax-lot / wash-sale guardrail logic — pending an explicit tax-lot / trade-history source design (cost-basis source, lot accounting model, wash-sale window scope).

## Do Not Build Yet

See `docs/product/DO_NOT_BUILD_YET.md`. Highlights:

- auto-trading
- LLM-owned visible financial decisions
- broker execution
- raw metric-heavy UI
- full design sprint before Deploy / Watchtower loop is stable
